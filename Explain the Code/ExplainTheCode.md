<pre>
GitHub Copilot: This is a JavaScript function that implements the binary search algorithm. The function takes two arguments: an array of any type and a key of any type. The function returns the index of the key in the array if it is found, otherwise it returns -1.

The binary search algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. At each step, the middle element of the interval is compared to the key. If the middle element is equal to the key, the search is successful and the index of the middle element is returned. If the middle element is greater than the key, the search continues in the left half of the interval. If the middle element is less than the key, the search continues in the right half of the interval.

The function initializes two variables, low and high, to the first and last indices of the array, respectively. It then enters a while loop that continues as long as the low index is less than or equal to the high index. At each iteration of the loop, the middle index is calculated as the average of the low and high indices, and the corresponding element of the array is retrieved. If the element is equal to the key, the index of the element is returned. If the element is greater than the key, the high index is updated to be one less than the middle index, effectively narrowing the search interval to the left half. If the element is less than the key, the low index is updated to be one more than the middle index, effectively narrowing the search interval to the right half. If the loop completes without finding the key, the function returns -1.

Overall, this is a well-written implementation of the binary search algorithm in JavaScript. The function uses clear variable names and follows good coding practices such as using const for variables that do not change. One possible improvement would be to add comments to explain the purpose of each section of the code.
